    "# Methods and plan:  \n",
    "#### Method:  \n",
    "I will use a knn classification model to predict whether a player will subscribe to the game related newsletter using  average session length, total played hours, and total number of sessions as my predictive variables.  \n",
    "#### Why this method:   \n",
    "Knn classification is the method best suited to classification that we have learned so far. With knn the data doesn't need to be any particular shape, it can classify even if relationships in data are nonlinear. \n",
    "#### Assumptions:\n",
    "Knn assumes that variables are scaled and centered as needed, and that players that have similar session characteristics will have the same subscription status.\n",
    "#### Limitations:  \n",
    "Knn doesn't work well when classes are uneven, which could cause a problem given that the data here is fairly uneven.  \n",
    "#### Model selections:  \n",
    "I will tune the value of k using 5 fold cross validation and compare each model using accuracy to find the value of k that gives the best performance.   \n",
    "#### Data Processing and Splitting:\n",
    "I will normalize the data then split it into a training set and a test set with a 70/30 split. I will perform 5 fold cross validation on the training set to find the best model and evaluate using the test set."
